title: I am learning Japanese!
---
I am going to embark on a 6 month journey (177 days starting now) to learn Japanese! My general strategy is:

- Use Memrise for basic expressions, intros, katakana, and hiragana (https://www.memrise.com/home/) 
- Use NihongoShark's ANKI Kanji deck (https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1956010956)
- Take a weekly Italki lesson (https://www.italki.com/lesson/session/3431361057)
- Work through the Genki Books 1 and 2 for practice writing and grammar (http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/about_en) 

I hope to spend about 3 hours a day on this as soon as the semester ends. When school starts, I plan on taking 3 courses to account for time for this (Or I will take the intro japanese class if they let me.)


Wish me luck!
