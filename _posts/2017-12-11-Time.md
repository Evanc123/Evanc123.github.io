Just a quick note about a Kanji I really enjoy. The Kanji for time is made up of the symbol for day/sun on the left, followed by soil 土 (Soil) on top and glue on the bottom. The combination of a soil on top of glue is the symbol for buddhist temple 寺(buddhist temple) . You can imagine a Buddhist Monk glued to the ground (the soil), unmoving, carving foot inprints into the wood over the years. When you add the sun to that equation, its as if the buddhist monk is contemplating the day, the sun, time in general  時 (Time). I conjure up a very profound image of a wise monk sitting in the sun, considering time and the universe. kanji is fun!
