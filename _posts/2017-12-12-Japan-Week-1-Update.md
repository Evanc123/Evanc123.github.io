I am 1 week into memorizing the 2200 kanji. I recently learned about the kanji for outside, 外. It popped up in a language blog in the form 外来語 (foreign loan word). Foreign loan words are words like Banana (バナナ) which is a phonetic translation of an english word. Loan words are written in Katakana, as opposed to Hiragana/Kanji, which are used for Japanese native words such as tea (お茶). When reading 外来語, I recognized the symbol for outside 外, and I also recognized name 語. So from the context, I was able to infer that the compound meant foreign word! I'm pretty excited about that. Baby steps. 

Anki says I have studied for about 200 minutes this past week, but the reality is probably double or triple that as writing out and coming up with mnemonic stories takes a while (and anki does not log that). I have spent 8 hours on the memrise site in the Japanese 1 program. I unfortunately missed my first italki meetup because I slept in! I needed the sleep though so I forgive myself. 

Wish me luck on continual progress!
