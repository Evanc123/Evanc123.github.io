I am 1 week into memorizing the 2200 kanji. I recently learned about the kanji for outside, 外. It popped up in a language blog in the form 外来語, or foreign loan word. I realized that I also knew 語, which means word. So from the context, I was able to infer that the compound meant foreign word! I'm pretty excited about that.  

Anki says I have studied for about 200 minutes this past week, but the reality is probably double or triple that as writing out and coming up with mnemonic stories takes a while (and anki does not log that). I have spent 8 hours on the memrise site in the Japanese 1 program. I unfortunately missed my first italki meetup because I slept in! I needed the sleep though so I forgive myself. 

Wish me luck on continual progress!
