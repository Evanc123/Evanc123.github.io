Still going strong!
I am still converging on the best way to study, I have moved away from the memrise cirriculumn as I feel unprepared to handle and memorize all the new random kanji that it presents.

I have been trying to practice the Kanji everyday from the NihongoShark deck inspired by Remember the Kanji. I've been working on my visualizations and memory palaces so that I remember the Kanji Better. 
Now that I can recognize about ~400 Kanji, my vocabulary study has gotten much easier. I find myself recognizing characters such as name and time, which is very satisfying. 

I've been working through the Genki I vocab book, with help from various Italki tutors. I find that practicing the genki exercises verbally with the tutors is quite helpful, especially when I modify the exercises to reflect my own life. For example, if the exercise talks about how someone has 2 sisters, I can modify it to saying I have one brother. This helps with visualization and retention. 

Additionally, I've been using an Anki deck for the Genki I vocabulary. 

I think it is going well so far, I am excited to continue and make massive gains in my Japanese study!
