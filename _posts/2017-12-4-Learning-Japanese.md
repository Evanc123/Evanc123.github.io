title: I am learning Japanese!
---
I am going to embark on a 6 month journey (177 days starting now) to learn Japanese! My general strategy is:

- <a href="https://www.memrise.com/home/">Use Memrise for basic expressions, intros, katakana, and hiragana</a> 
- <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1956010956">Use NihongoShark's ANKI Kanji deck</a>
- <a href="https://www.italki.com/lesson/session/3431361057">Take a weekly Italki lesson</a> 
- <a href="http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/about_en">Work through the Genki Books 1 and 2 for practice writing and grammar</a> 

I hope to spend about 3 hours a day on this as soon as the semester ends. When school starts, I plan on taking 3 courses to account for time for this (Or I will take the intro japanese class if they let me.)


Wish me luck!
