I am still steadily learning Japanese. 

The symbol for grind (磨) is hilarious. It is made up of the symbol for hemp (麻) with a stone below it. In other words, when you use a stone on the hemp, you grind it so you can get higher! The Kanji is full of fun stories like that when you have the imagination. 

I fell off the horse when it came to studying the past week and a half, I barely took a dent out of my daily kanji practice. I am starting up the new semester so I hope my habits and systems kick in (waking up early, big breakfast, meditation, working out etc) and I continue to make good progress. Heres to fluency!

another one is 慎 (humility)
